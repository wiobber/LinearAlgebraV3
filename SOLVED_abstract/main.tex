\section*{Solved Problems for Chapter 9}

\begin{problem}\label{prb:10.17} Let $M,N$ be subspaces of a vector space $V$ and consider $M+N$
defined as the set of all $m+n$ where $m\in M$ and $n\in N$. Show that $M+N$
is a subspace of $V$.

\begin{expandable}
    We need to show that $M+N$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. 
 (See Theorem \ref{th:subspacetestabstract}.)  Suppose $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ are in $M+N$.  Then $\vec{x}=m_1+n_1$ and $\vec{y}=m_2+n_2$, where $m_i$ is in $M$ and $n_i$ is in $N$.  To see that $M+N$ is closed under scalar multiplication, consider $a\vec{x}=a(m_1+n_1)=am_1+an_1$.  Since $am_1$ is in $M$, and $an_1$ is in $N$, $\vec{x}$ is in $M+N$.  Next, we show that $M+N$ is closed under vector addition. $\vec{x}+\vec{y}=(m_1+m_2)+(n_1+n_2)$.  Since $(m_1+m_2)$ is an element of $M$, and $(n_1+n_2)$ is an element of $N$ we have closure under addition.
\end{expandable}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prb:10.18} Let $M,N$ be subspaces of a vector space $V$. Then $M\cap N$ consists
of all vectors which are in both $M$ and $N$. Show that $M\cap N$ is a
subspace of $V$.

\begin{expandable}
    If a vector is in both subspaces $M$ and $N$, then its scalar multiple must also be in both.  Same is true about the sum of two elements of $M\cap N$.
\end{expandable}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prb:10.19} Let $M,N$ be subspaces of a vector space $\mathbb{R}^{2}.$ Then $N\cup
M$ consists of all vectors which are in either $M$ or $N$. Show that $N\cup
M $ is not necessarily a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by giving an example
where $N\cup M$ fails to be a subspace.

\begin{expandable}
    As our example, let $M$ to be the first quadrant, and let $N$ be the third quadrant.
\end{expandable}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prob:lintransmultbyx1}
Define $T:\mathbb{P}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^3$ by $T(p(x))=xp(x)$.  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find $T(-x^2+2x-4)$.
    \item Is $T$ a linear transformation?  If so, prove it.  If not, give a counterexample.
\end{enumerate}

Click the arrow to see answer.

\begin{expandable}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $T(-x^2+2x-4)=-x^3+2x^2-4x$
        \item $T(ap(x)+bq(x))=x(ap(x)+bq(x))=axp(x)+bxq(x)=aT(p(x))+bT(p(x))$.  $T$ is a linear transformation.
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{expandable}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prb:10.24} Let $p(x) = 4x^2-x$. Is $p(x)$ in
 $\mbox{span} \left( x^2+x, x^2-1, -x + 2 \right)$?  Consider the question in two different ways, then compare your work for each approach.
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item Do this directly using the definition of span (Definition \ref{def:lincombabstract}).
     \item Do this using isomorphisms.
 \end{enumerate}

Click the arrow to see answer.
\begin{expandable}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Apply the definition of span directly.  We are looking for coefficients $a$, $b$ and $c$ such that 
        $$ax^2+ax+bx^2-b-cx+2c=4x^2-x$$
        Collecting like terms on the left and setting their coefficients equal to their counterparts on the right gives us the following system of equations.
        $$a+b=4$$
        $$a-c=-1$$
        $$-b+2c=0$$
        This gives rise to the augmented matrix
        $$\left[
\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 & 1 & 0 & 4 \\
1 & 0 & -1 & -1\\
0 & -1 & 2 & 0
\end{array}
\right]\rightsquigarrow \left[
\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 & 0 & 0 & 2/3 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 10/3\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 5/3
\end{array}
\right]$$
This shows that our system has a unique solution and gives us the specific coefficients to express $p(x)$ as a linear combination of the vectors in the given set.
\item We can also look at this problem in light of isomorphisms.  Let's start by mapping $$x^2+x\mapsto\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\0\end{bmatrix},\quad x^2-1\mapsto\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\-1\end{bmatrix}, \quad -x+2\mapsto\begin{bmatrix}0\\-1\\2\end{bmatrix}$$
(Why is this an isomorphism?)

Is the vector $\begin{bmatrix}4\\-1\\0\end{bmatrix}$ in the span of the three vectors above?  Set up an augmented matrix to answer this question.  Compare this matrix to the matrix in part (a).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{expandable}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prb:10.25} Let $p(x) = - x^2 + x + 2 $. Is $p(x)$ in $\mbox{span} \left( x^2 + x + 1, 2x^2 + x \right)$?

Click the arrow to see answer.
\begin{expandable}
    $p(x)$ is not in the span of the given vectors.  The system 
    $$\left[
\begin{array}{rr|r}
1 & 0 & 2 \\
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 2 & -1
\end{array}
\right]$$
is infeasible.
\end{expandable}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prb:10.28} Consider the vector space of polynomials of degree at most $2$, $\mathbb{P}_{2}$. Determine whether the following is a basis for $\mathbb{P}_{2}$.
\begin{equation*}
\left\{ x^{2}+x+1,2x^{2}+2x+1,x+1\right\}
\end{equation*}

Click the arrow to see answer.
\begin{expandable}
There is a isomorphism from $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ to $\mathbb{P}
_{2}$, defined as follows:
$$
T(\vec{e}_{1})=1,\quad T(\vec{e}_{2})=x,\quad T(\vec{e}_{3})=x^{2}
$$
Thus,
$$
T\left(\left[
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
1 \\
1
\end{array}
\right]\right) =x^{2}+x+1,\quad T\left(\left[
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
2 \\
2
\end{array}
\right]\right) =2x^{2}+2x+1,\quad T\left(\left[
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
1 \\
0
\end{array}
\right]\right) =1+x
$$
It follows that if
$$
\left\{ \left[
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
1 \\
1
\end{array}
\right] ,\left[
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
2 \\
2
\end{array}
\right] ,\left[
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
1 \\
0
\end{array}
\right] \right\}
$$
is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^{3},$ then the polynomials will be a basis for $
\mathbb{P}_{2}$ because they will be independent. Recall that an isomorphism
takes a linearly independent set to a linearly independent set. Also, since $
T$ is an isomorphism, it preserves all linear relations.
\end{expandable}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prb:10.29} Find a basis in $\mathbb{P}_{2}$ for the subspace
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{span}\left( 1+x+x^{2},1+2x,1+5x-3x^{2}\right)
\end{equation*}
If the above three vectors do not yield a basis, exhibit one of them as a
linear combination of the others. 

Click the arrow to see answer.
\begin{expandable}
This is the situation in
which you have a spanning set and you want to cut it down to form a linearly
independent set which is also a spanning set. Use the same isomorphism as
above. Since $T$ is an isomorphism, it preserves all linear relations so if
such can be found in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, the same linear relations will be
present in $\mathbb{P}_{2}$.
\end{expandable}
\end{problem}
